# A Collection of ML/DL Models

These are models I came across during my studies (through various) courses.
Since the main purpose of this project is to remind myself how these methods work and to get more familiar
with the JAX framework, this repository will be filled over the course of the next weeks.

## Generative Models

Some types of Generative Models that will be included:

* Normalizing Flows
* (Variational Inference on univariate gaussian mixtures)
* Variational Autoencoders
* Generative Adversarial Networks

## Bayesian Optimization

A collection of Gaussian Process Regression, different acquisition functions, and kernel methods.
